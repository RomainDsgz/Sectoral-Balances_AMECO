The objective of this repository is to provide economists with a tool to analyse the distribution of national income in a given economy, using AMECO's database. The approach of sectoral balances is inspired by the Macroeconomics textbook of Mitchell, Wray and Watts (2019). Data can be retrieved here: https://economy-finance.ec.europa.eu/economic-research-and-databases/economic-databases/ameco-database_en

The first part of this script, data collection and cleaning, is largely inspired by guillemvidal (https://github.com/guillemvidal/AMECO_GDP_deflator).
