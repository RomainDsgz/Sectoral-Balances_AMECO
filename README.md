The objective of this repository is to provide economists a tool to analyse the distribution of national income in a given economy, using AMECO's database. The approach of sectoral balances is inspired by the Macroeconomics textbook of Mitchell, Wray and Watts (2019) (https://books.google.ch/books/about/Macroeconomics.html?id=kTxBMQAACAAJ&redir_esc=y)

The first part of this script, data collection and cleaning, is largely inspired by guillemvidal (https://github.com/guillemvidal/AMECO_GDP_deflator).
